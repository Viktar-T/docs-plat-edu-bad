# System Architecture

Detailed system design, component interactions, and data flow diagrams.

## Overview

This section provides comprehensive documentation about the system architecture of the IoT Educational and Research Platform.

## Architecture Components

The platform architecture consists of multiple layers:

- **Hardware Layer**: Sensors and IoT devices
- **Data Acquisition Layer**: MQTT brokers and data loggers
- **Cloud Infrastructure Layer**: Node-RED, InfluxDB, ThingsBoard
- **Application Layer**: Web applications and visualization dashboards
- **Analytics Layer**: Data processing and machine learning capabilities

## Data Flow

Data flows from physical sensors through communication protocols (MQTT, RS-485) to cloud infrastructure for processing, storage, and visualization.
