## Data Acquisition System

### Current Situation

The system is already connected to a small on-board PC. The PC communicates with the 
measurement hardware via RS-485. It runs a proprietary software interface that displays 
system data on a dedicated screen. Full data access currently requires login credentials: (ask for credentials from the KIOZE department staff)  <!-- (admin and 123) -->

### Problems

Attempts to log in to the algae software (with ZUT VPN enabled) were unsuccessful. The login page does not show an error message and appears to timeout. Also, the disk space at the algae farm currently is out of storage, but there were no apparent reasons why. This situation would require further investigation of possible reasons.
