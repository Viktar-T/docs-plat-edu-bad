- Maintain test coverage above 85%

```python
# Good example
def process_sensor_data(
    data: Dict[str, Any], 
    validation_rules: List[ValidationRule]
) -> ProcessedData:
    """Process incoming sensor data with validation.
    
    Args:
        data: Raw sensor data dictionary
        validation_rules: List of validation rules to apply
        
    Returns:
        ProcessedData object with validated and cleaned data
        
    Raises:
        ValidationError: If data fails validation rules
    """
    validated_data = validate_data(data, validation_rules)
    return ProcessedData(validated_data)
```

**JavaScript/TypeScript Standards**
- Use ESLint and Prettier for formatting

  timestamp: Date;
  temperature: number;
  humidity: number;
  quality: 'good' | 'questionable' | 'bad';
}

const processSensorReading = (
  reading: SensorReading
): ProcessedReading => {
  // Implementation with proper error handling
  if (!validateReading(reading)) {
    throw new ValidationError('Invalid sensor reading');
  }
  
  return {
    ...reading,
    processed: true,
    processedAt: new Date(),
  };
};
```

**C++ (Arduino) Standards**
- Follow Google C++ Style Guide

```cpp
// Good example
class TemperatureSensor {
private:
    static constexpr float INVALID_TEMPERATURE = -999.0f;
    static constexpr int MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 3;
    
public:
    /**
     * Read temperature with error handling and retry logic
     * @return Temperature in Celsius or INVALID_TEMPERATURE on failure
     */
    float readTemperature() {
        for (int attempt = 0; attempt < MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS; ++attempt) {
            float temp = performReading();
            
            if (isValidTemperature(temp)) {
                return temp;
            }
            
            delay(100); // Brief delay before retry
        }
        
        return INVALID_TEMPERATURE;
    }
    
private:
    bool isValidTemperature(float temp) const {
        return !isnan(temp) && temp >= -40.0f && temp <= 85.0f;
    }
};
```

### Documentation Contributions
