# System Architecture

## Overview

The Educational Platform for Bad Data Science follows a modular, four-phase architecture designed to demonstrate scalable data science solutions and common implementation challenges.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Modularity
Each phase operates independently while maintaining clear interfaces with other components.

### 2. Scalability
The system is designed to handle varying data loads and user demands.

### 3. Educational Focus
Every component includes examples of both correct implementations and common pitfalls.

### 4. Real-world Applicability
The architecture mirrors industry-standard patterns and practices.
