# Real-Time Monitoring Educational and Research Platforms for Integrated Renewable Energy Sources and Energy Storage Systems

## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive framework for building real-time monitoring platforms for renewable energy systems and energy storage. The platform is designed for educational and research purposes, enabling students, educators, and researchers to monitor, analyze, and visualize energy data from various sources.

### Target Audience
- **Educators**: Teaching renewable energy concepts and IoT monitoring
- **Researchers**: Conducting energy system analysis and optimization studies
- **Students**: Learning practical IoT and energy monitoring skills

### Key Features
- Real-time data acquisition from renewable energy sources
- Cloud-based data storage and processing
- Advanced visualization and analytics capabilities
- Scalable architecture supporting multiple devices
- Educational simulation capabilities for hardware-free learning

## Web Application

A modern React-based web application has been developed to provide an intuitive interface for the energy monitoring platform. The application features:

- **Interactive Department Map**: Visual representation of laboratory equipment with real-time data dashboards
- **Real-time Data Visualization**: Live monitoring of energy systems using Recharts
- **Responsive Design**: Modern UI built with React 18, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- **Educational Interface**: User-friendly navigation for students and researchers
