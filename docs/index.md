# Project Overview

Welcome to the Educational Platform for Bad Data Science project documentation. This comprehensive platform is designed to demonstrate common pitfalls and best practices in data science through a multi-phase implementation approach.

## Project Vision

This project serves as an educational tool that showcases real-world data science challenges and solutions, emphasizing the importance of proper data handling, analysis, and visualization techniques.

## Project Phases

The project is structured into four distinct phases, each building upon the previous one:

### Phase 1: Hardware & Data Acquisition
- Sensor integration and hardware setup
- Data collection systems
- IoT device management
- Real-time data streaming

### Phase 2: Cloud Infrastructure
- Scalable cloud architecture
- Data pipelines and processing
- Database management
- Security implementation

### Phase 3: Web Application
- User interface development
- API integration
- Frontend/backend architecture
- User experience design

### Phase 4: Visualization & Analytics
- Interactive dashboards
- Advanced analytics
- Data visualization tools
- User guides and documentation

### Phase 5: Analytics
-
