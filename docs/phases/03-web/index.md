# Phase 3: Web Development Phase

Welcome to the Web Development phase of the Educational Platform for Bad Data Science. This phase focuses on creating an intuitive, responsive, and educational web interface that allows users to interact with IoT sensor data, understand data quality issues, and learn data science concepts through hands-on experience.

## Phase Overview

The web development phase encompasses the creation of a comprehensive web application that serves as the primary interface for students, teachers, and administrators to interact with the platform. The application provides real-time data visualization, educational content, project management tools, and collaborative features.

### Key Objectives

1. **Educational Interface Design**: Create intuitive interfaces that facilitate learning about data science and data quality
2. **Real-time Data Interaction**: Provide seamless access to live sensor data with interactive visualizations
