# Project Phases

This section contains documentation for all four phases of the Educational Platform for Bad Data Science project. Each phase represents a distinct component of the system that integrates to form the complete educational platform.

## Phase Overview

The project is structured into four main phases, each building upon the previous to create a comprehensive educational platform:

### [Phase 1: Hardware](./hardware/)
The foundation phase focuses on IoT devices and sensor networks for data collection. This phase covers:
- **Hardware Components**: ESP32 microcontrollers, environmental sensors, power management
- **Data Acquisition**: Real-time sensor data collection and initial processing
- **Communication**: WiFi, MQTT, and cellular connectivity options
- **Integration**: Protocols for connecting hardware to cloud infrastructure

### [Phase 2: Cloud Infrastructure](./cloud/)
The backend phase implements scalable cloud services for data processing and storage:
- **Cloud Architecture**: Microservices design using Azure/AWS services
- **Data Pipelines**: Stream processing, validation, and quality control systems
- **Database Design**: Multi-database strategy for operational and analytical data
- **API Development**: RESTful APIs with real-time communication capabilities
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, and data protection measures
- **Deployment**: Containerization and orchestration strategies

### [Phase 3: Web Application](./web/)
The frontend phase creates an intuitive web interface for user interaction:
- **Technology Stack**: React, TypeScript, and modern web frameworks
- **User Experience**: Responsive design for multiple device types
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts, dashboards, and real-time displays
- **Educational Features**: Guided tutorials, collaborative tools, and progress tracking
- **Performance**: Optimization strategies for large datasets and real-time updates

### [Phase 4: Visualization & Analytics](./visualization/)
The analytics phase provides advanced data analysis and visualization capabilities:
- **Dashboard Design**: Customizable analytics dashboards
- **Analytics Methods**: Statistical analysis, anomaly detection, and machine learning
- **Visualization Tools**: Advanced charting libraries and interactive displays
- **User Guidance**: Educational content integrated with analytical features

## Integration Points

Each phase is designed to integrate seamlessly with others:

### Data Flow
1. **Hardware → Cloud**: Sensor data transmitted via MQTT/HTTP to cloud services
2. **Cloud → Web**: Real-time data streaming and API responses to web application
3. **Cloud → Visualization**: Processed data feeding analytics and visualization components
4. **Web ↔ Visualization**: Interactive integration for user-driven analytics

### Educational Workflow
1. **Setup Phase**: Hardware configuration and project initialization
2. **Data Collection**: Real-time monitoring and quality assessment
3. **Analysis Phase**: Interactive exploration of data patterns and issues
4. **Learning Outcomes**: Collaborative annotation and knowledge building
